# runMercury.bash

This collection of scripts replaces the startup scripts included in the original distribution of 
[Mercury 3.10](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/mercury/), to be found in
```
/path/to/mercury/bin
```

I have deliberately chosen to suffix them with bash, to make the distinction clear.

The scripts should not break on creating a symlink to them anymore. They have been checked with 
`shellcheck` and returned no error.

Obviously, **use them on your own risk**! There is no warrenty, whatsoever.
